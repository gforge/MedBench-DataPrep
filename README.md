# MedBench-DataPrep

## Overview

Welcome to the MedBench-DataPrep repository. This repository contains R functions necessary for generating data for the MedBench research study. The study aims to create a benchmark dataset of fictional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to evaluate and improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medical documentation tasks.

## Study Objectives

- **Dataset Creation**: Develop a comprehensive dataset of fictional EHRs, covering a wide range of medical scenarios.
- **Benchmarking**: Establish benchmarks to assess LLM performance in handling medical jargon, demographic diversity, and factual inconsistencies.
- **Evaluation**: Implement methods to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the generated medical documentation.

## Methods

- **EHR Structure**: Each case includes core medical notes and related lab and medication data.
- **Dataset Composition**: The dataset will reflect standard medical scenarios and include variations to test LLM capabilities under different conditions.
- **Prompt Methodology**: Explore advanced prompting techniques to enhance LLM performance in generating medical documentation.
